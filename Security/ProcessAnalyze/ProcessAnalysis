Workflow Integration

You can combine these commands to form a comprehensive investigation sequence, such as:

    Use pstree to identify suspicious processes.

    Use htop to monitor resource consumption.

    Use lsof for file/network analysis.

    Use strace for real-time system calls.

    Use tcpdump for traffic monitoring.

    Use Volatility and Auditd for advanced forensic and long-term monitoring
