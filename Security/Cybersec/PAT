Port Address Translation (PAT)

Port Address Translation (PAT) is a type of Network Address Translation (NAT) that allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address. It achieves this by mapping multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address, using different port numbers to distinguish the traffic.
How PAT Works

    Source IP and Port Translation: When data packets leave a private network, PAT replaces the private IP address of the device with the network's public IP address. It also replaces the source port number with a unique port number.

    Port Mapping Table: A mapping table is maintained to track which private IP and port correspond to a given public IP and port. This enables the router to correctly forward incoming packets to the appropriate internal device.

    Reverse Translation: When the response arrives at the public IP address, PAT uses the mapping table to determine which private device the data should be forwarded to.

Key Advantages of PAT

    Efficient IP Address Use: By allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address, PAT conserves IPv4 addresses.

    Enhanced Security: Internal private IP addresses are hidden, making it harder for external entities to directly target devices inside the network.

    Traffic Differentiation: It uses port numbers to manage and distinguish traffic for multiple devices effectively.

Example of PAT

Suppose you have three devices in your private network (IP: 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, and 192.168.1.4). When they access the internet:

    All their requests are sent using the single public IP (e.g., 203.0.113.5).

    PAT assigns unique port numbers to each request (e.g., 203.0.113.5:1025, 203.0.113.5:1026).

    When responses arrive, the router uses the port numbers to forward them to the correct device.
