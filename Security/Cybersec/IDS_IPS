Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

IDS and IPS are critical components of network security, designed to detect and prevent unauthorized access or malicious activities. Here's a detailed overview:
Types of IDS

    Network-Based IDS (NIDS):

        Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities.

        Deployed at strategic points like gateways or routers.

        Example: Detecting unusual traffic patterns or port scans.

    Host-Based IDS (HIDS):

        Monitors activities on individual devices or hosts.

        Tracks file changes, logins, and system calls.

        Example: Detecting unauthorized file modifications.

    Protocol-Based IDS (PIDS):

        Focuses on monitoring specific protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

        Ensures protocol compliance and detects anomalies.

    Application Protocol-Based IDS (APIDS):

        Monitors application-level protocols for suspicious behavior.

        Example: Detecting SQL injection attacks in web applications.

    Hybrid IDS:

        Combines features of multiple IDS types for comprehensive monitoring.

        Example: A system that integrates NIDS and HIDS.

Types of IPS

    Network-Based IPS (NIPS):

        Deployed at network entry points to block malicious traffic.

        Example: Preventing DDoS attacks by filtering traffic.

    Host-Based IPS (HIPS):

        Protects individual devices by blocking malicious activities.

        Example: Stopping malware execution on a host.

    Signature-Based IPS:

        Detects threats based on known attack patterns or signatures.

        Example: Blocking traffic matching a known malware signature.

    Anomaly-Based IPS:

        Identifies deviations from normal behavior to detect unknown threats.

        Example: Detecting zero-day attacks.

    Policy-Based IPS:

        Enforces predefined security policies to block unauthorized actions.

        Example: Blocking access to restricted websites.

Usage of IDS/IPS

    Threat Detection: IDS identifies potential threats and alerts administrators, while IPS actively blocks them.

    Network Security: Protects networks from unauthorized access, malware, and DDoS attacks.

    Compliance: Ensures adherence to security policies and regulatory requirements.

    Incident Response: Provides valuable data for analyzing and responding to security incidents.

History of IDS/IPS

    1980s: The concept of intrusion detection emerged with Dorothy Denning's paper, "An Intrusion-Detection Model," which introduced statistical anomaly detection.

    1990s: Early IDS systems like the Intrusion Detection Expert System (IDES) were developed, focusing on rule-based detection.

    2000s: IPS gained popularity as organizations sought proactive measures to block threats. Signature-based and anomaly-based detection methods became standard.

    Present Day: Modern IDS/IPS systems integrate machine learning, AI, and advanced analytics for real-time threat detection and prevention.
