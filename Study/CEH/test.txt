Exercise 4
Scenario: You are in the process of reviewing events at the customer Acme
Incorporated, located in the United States. At one point, you encountered several
events suggesting a malware infection on the ABC, CDE, and FGH systems. You
could see the attack flow reviewing those events. During the analysis of these
events, you determined that the source of infection was a phishing email with a
malicious document that each one of the users received in his/her inbox. Your
analysis also concludes that each user successfully launched the malicious
document and that document successfully downloaded a malware variant from
the Internet called Emotet. The download was successful, and each one of the
systems was compromised with this Emotet malware.

Task: Please write a brief summary of how you would notify the customer of this
information.
What information will you include in this notification? How would you present it to
the customer to ensure they( Customers) know and understand the attack flow?
Your summary must be in English.

Tip for writing this notification:
● Remember to include a brief description of this threat so the customer can
understand
the attack flow.
● Please provide recommended actions on what the customer should do to
remediate this
threat.
Note: This question is about creativity and testing your ability to notify the
customer about a threat in a way that the customer can understand. This is less
about the technical aspect.

Scenario-Based Questions:
Scenario 1:
You are a cyber security professional and ethical hacker. You recently changed to
a new company. What will you do to protect the organization from a possible data
breach if there is a critical attack?
Scenario 2:
In an organization, few users report phishing emails to the security team. Most of
the emails are triggered from one particular domain. As a security analyst or
cyber security professional, explain your approach to stopping the phishing
attack.

You are a cyber security professional and work in the Red Team. Your employer
asked if they are planning to release a new product and make sure it has to be
vulnerability free to avoid the zero-day attack. As a red team member, explain
your workflow and report if you find anything vulnerable. (Red Team is Nothing
but CEH practicals you have done)
