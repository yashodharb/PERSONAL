1] Name six different administrative controls used to secure personnel.

Security Policies

Define rules and expectations for employee behavior regarding security practices (e.g., acceptable use policy, data classification policy).

Background Checks

Conducted before hiring to verify a candidate’s criminal, employment, and credit history, helping to reduce insider threats.

Security Awareness Training

Educates employees on identifying threats like phishing, proper data handling, and secure use of systems.

Job Rotation

Employees periodically switch roles or responsibilities to reduce fraud risks and ensure no one has exclusive control.

Separation of Duties (SoD)

Splits critical tasks between individuals to prevent abuse of power or fraud (e.g., one person authorizes a transaction, another executes it).

Termination Procedures

Ensures secure offboarding of employees, including revoking access, conducting exit interviews, and collecting company asset



2] What are the seven major steps or phases in the implementation of a classification scheme?

Identify Data Owners

Assign responsibility for classifying and managing data to specific business units or individuals (data owners).

Establish a Classification Policy

Develop and formalize the rules, criteria, and categories (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Highly Confidential) for classifying data.

Data Inventory and Mapping

Locate and document where data is stored, how it's transmitted, and who has access—this helps determine classification needs.

Classify the Data

Apply classification labels to data based on its sensitivity, value, and regulatory requirements.

Implement Controls Based on Classification

Apply security controls (e.g., encryption, access controls, logging) appropriate to the classification level.

User Training and Awareness

Train employees on how to recognize, handle, and protect classified data according to the policy.

Monitor, Audit, and Review

Continuously monitor classification practices, conduct audits, and update classifications and policies as business needs or regulations change.

3] What are the four main steps of the business continuity planning process?

Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

Identify and evaluate the effects of disruptions on business operations.

Determine critical functions, dependencies, Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs), and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).

Risk Assessment

Identify potential threats (natural, technical, human) and assess the likelihood and impact of each.

Evaluate existing controls and identify vulnerabilities.

Strategy Development

Design recovery strategies and solutions to maintain or restore operations.

This may include alternate sites (hot/warm/cold), cloud backup, remote work plans, and communication strategies.

Plan Development and Testing

Document the BCP, assign roles, and establish procedures.

Regularly test (e.g., tabletop exercises, simulations) and update the plan to ensure effectiveness.

4] Describe the difference between scoping and tailoring. 

Scoping
Definition: The process of determining which security controls are applicable to an information system based on factors such as system function, environment, operational constraints, and risk tolerance.

Focus: Selecting relevant controls.

Example: If a system is not connected to the internet, controls related to external network threats may be scoped out.

Tailoring
Definition: The process of modifying or refining the selected security controls to better fit the specific context of the organization or system.

Focus: Customizing the chosen controls.

Example: Adjusting password length requirements from the baseline policy to align with the organization's authentication needs

5] Describe the best method to sanitize SSDs

ATA Secure Erase: Often built into SSD firmware, but may not work consistently across manufacturers.

Physical destruction: Works, but not always necessary unless the drive is highly sensitive and being decommissioned.

Overwriting (wiping): Not reliable for SSDs due to wear-leveling and hidden memory cells.
