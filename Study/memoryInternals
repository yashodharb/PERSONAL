Goals of this topic is to learn how physical address space is mapped to virtual addresses.

MMU -> Memory Management Unit.

If physical addresses are P bits, then the maximum amount of
addressable physical memory is 2P bytes

A physical address refers to a memory location. Each physical address points to a unit of memory. But what unit?
In almost all modern computer architectures, each memory address points to 1 byte of memory.
This is a design decision in most systems. That’s why:
1 address = 1 byte

What does a P-bit address mean?
A P-bit physical address means each address is made up of P bits, and therefore there are:
2ᴾ unique address values
So the system can generate 2ᴾ distinct addresses, i.e., can point to 2ᴾ distinct memory locations.

What is stored at each address?
Each of those addresses points to 1 byte.
So if you can generate 2ᴾ addresses, and each address refers to 1 byte, then:

Total addressable memory = 2ᴾ bytes

Why not bits? Why bytes?

Because computer systems are byte-addressable.

That means:

Address 0 → 1 byte

Address 1 → next byte

Address 15 (if P = 4) → 16th byte

If systems were bit-addressable, then yes — you’d say 2ᴾ bits instead. But that’s rare and inefficient.

Final Summary:
Concept	Value
Address size	P bits
Number of addresses	2ᴾ
Size per address	1 byte
Total addressable memory	2ᴾ bytes ✅

Example: P = 4
Address range: 0000 to 1111 → 16 total addresses
Each address points to: 1 byte
→ 16 bytes of total addressable memory = 2⁴ bytes
