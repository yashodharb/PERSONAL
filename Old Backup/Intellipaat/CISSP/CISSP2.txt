2]Explain the process Bob should use to digitally sign a message to Alice.

	Bob hashes the message
	Bob encrypts the hash with his private key to create a signature
	Bob sends the message + signature to Alice
	Alice hashes the message and compares it with the decrypted signature (using Bob’s public key)

3] What are the two primary rules or principles of the Bell-LaPadula security model? Also, what are the two rules of Biba? 

model is designed to protect confidentiality—making sure sensitive information doesn't leak down to users without clearance.

Two Primary Rules:
Simple Security Property ("No Read Up")

A subject at a lower security level cannot read data at a higher security level.

Prevents unauthorized access to classified data.


Star (*) Security Property ("No Write Down")

A subject at a higher security level cannot write data to a lower level.

Prevents leaking secrets to lower-clearance levels.


The Biba model, on the other hand, aims to protect integrity—making sure data isn't improperly modified by less trusted sources.

Two Rules:
Simple Integrity Property ("No Read Down")

A subject at a higher integrity level cannot read data at a lower integrity level.

Prevents contamination by untrusted data.

Integrity Property ("No Write Up")

A subject at a lower integrity level cannot write data to a higher integrity level.

Prevents less trustworthy users from corrupting more trusted data.




4] What are the four security modes for systems processing classified information

1. Dedicated Security Mode
All users have the necessary clearance.

All users have formal access approval.

All users have a valid need-to-know for all information on the system.

Since everyone has access to everything, no additional access controls are required by the system.

This is the most restrictive in terms of user access requirements but the simplest to implement technically.

2. System High Security Mode
All users have the necessary clearance and formal access approvals.

Not all users have a need-to-know for all the information.

The system must enforce access controls based on need-to-know.

This mode requires more sophisticated internal access control mechanisms compared to the dedicated mode.

3. Compartmented Security Mode
Not all users have the same clearance levels, formal access, or need-to-know.

The system must enforce access based on a combination of clearance, formal access approval, and need-to-know.

Typically used when information is separated into compartments or categories.

This mode introduces more complexity in managing access control.

4. Multilevel Security Mode
Users have varying levels of clearance, access, and need-to-know.

The system enforces strict access controls using security labels and mandatory access control mechanisms.

Users can access only the information for which they have all three: appropriate clearance, formal approval, and need-to-know.

This mode supports simultaneous processing of multiple levels of classified information.



5] What kinds of potential issues can an emergency visit from the fire department leave in its wake?

 Physical Damage
Broken doors/windows: Firefighters may force entry if keys or access codes are unavailable.

Ceiling/wall damage: To check for fire spread, firefighters may break through ceilings or walls.

Water damage: From fire hoses or sprinkler activation, even for small incidents.

Damage to equipment: Sensitive IT, electrical, or lab equipment can be damaged by water or physical disruption.

2. System Disruptions
Sprinkler system activation: Can flood areas, trigger alarms, and damage electronics.

Power shutdowns: Fire response may require shutting off power for safety, affecting operations.

HVAC shutdowns: Systems may be stopped to prevent smoke spread, leading to overheating or system failure.

Access control disruptions: Doors held open or access systems bypassed during the response.

3. Operational Impact
Business interruption: Evacuation and damage can halt operations, even if only for a short time.

Data loss or server downtime: If server rooms are affected by power or water, data integrity can be compromised.

Contamination: Fire suppression chemicals or water can cause contamination in cleanrooms, labs, or kitchens.

4. Security Risks
Unsecured access points: After forced entry or during evacuation, doors may be left open or unlocked.

Disabled surveillance systems: Cameras or alarms may be temporarily shut down or damaged.

Loss of confidential materials: In the chaos, documents or devices might be misplaced or accessed inappropriately.

5. Compliance and Reporting Issues
Incident reporting requirements: Organizations may need to report to regulators, insurers, or compliance bodies.

Audit trail interruptions: Emergency shutdowns can disrupt logs and monitoring systems.

6. Safety and Health Concerns
Slippery floors or debris: Water and broken materials can create physical hazards.

Air quality issues: Smoke, dust, or fire suppression residue may remain in the environment.

Stress or trauma: Employees may experience anxiety or fear after an emergency incident.
