Memory is divided into two types:
	- Stack
	- Help


Stack
[Begins at Highest Possible Memory Address and grows Downwards in the memory,
meaning new data is added to lower memory addresses and the stack pointer moves to a lower memory addressas the stack fills up.]

when we call the assemblt, we use two operations.



Stack 0xFFFFFFFF [Pointer is decremented 4 bytes at a time: Self(I guess depends upon the size of the next data type in the stack)]
