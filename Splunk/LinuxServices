What Are Services in Linux?

In Linux, services are long-running background processes that perform essential tasks. They are typically referred to as daemons, and their names often end with the letter d (e.g., sshd, cron, httpd). Services are responsible for managing system functionalities, such as networking, file serving, logging, and more.
How Services Work

    Startup and Initialization:

        When the Linux system boots, an init system (like systemd, SysVinit, or Upstart) starts the services based on configuration files or unit files.

        Services can be configured to start automatically at boot, remain idle until triggered, or run on-demand.

    Control and Management:

        Services are controlled using commands like start, stop, restart, and status, typically through service managers like systemctl (used with systemd).

        Services run in the background, independent of user sessions, allowing them to manage tasks like networking, databases, or logging without interruption.

    Configuration Files:

        Services rely on configuration files (located in /etc/ for most Linux distributions) to define their behavior.

    Communication:

        Services communicate with users or other applications using logs, system calls, and interprocess communication (IPC).

A Brief History of Linux Services

    1970s: Unix Origins:

        Linux services derive their concept from Unix daemons introduced in the 1970s.

        Daemons were created to handle repetitive or essential tasks, like email processing or job scheduling.

    SysVinit (1983):

        Early Linux distributions used the SysVinit system for managing services, relying on shell scripts (/etc/init.d) to control services at different runlevels.

        This approach worked but was slow and lacked advanced features.

    Upstart (2006):

        Introduced to replace SysVinit, Upstart improved event-driven service handling. It was adopted by distributions like Ubuntu for faster service management.

    Systemd (2010):

        Modern Linux distributions use systemd, which replaced older init systems with a powerful, parallelized framework.

        It introduced features like unit files, dependency handling, and detailed logging (via journalctl).

How to Master Linux Services

    Understand the Basics:

        Learn commands for managing services:
        bash

    systemctl start <service-name>
    systemctl stop <service-name>
    systemctl restart <service-name>
    systemctl status <service-name>
    systemctl enable <service-name> # Start at boot
    systemctl disable <service-name> # Stop from starting at boot

Learn Service Configurations:

    Explore configuration files stored in /etc/ (e.g., /etc/systemd/system/ for systemd unit files).

    Modify or create unit files for custom services:
    bash

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/my-service.service

Example structure:
text

    [Unit]
    Description=My Custom Service
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/path/to/command
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Explore Logs:

    Use journalctl to view logs for services:
    bash

    journalctl -u <service-name>

Understand Init Systems:

    Study the differences between SysVinit, Upstart, and systemd. Most modern distributions use systemd, so focus on its capabilities.

Experiment with Service States:

    Use virtual machines to practice managing services:

        Enable/disable services.

        Create custom services.

        Troubleshoot services by simulating failures.

Learn Dependencies:

    Master dependency configurations for systemd services to ensure proper service startup order (e.g., After, Requires).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Linux, you can start a service like HTTP, Splunk, SSH, etc either by starting the service or you can do it manually as well.

We configured splunk to start as a service using the below command which made it possible to start splunk [Splunk-Daemon] using systemctl or service:
	- ./splunk enable boot-start -systemd-managed 1

Now we can use commands like

	- systemctl start/stop/status splunkd
	- service splunkd start/stop/status


To start it manually, below is the path:
	- cd /opt/splunk/bin
	- ./splunk start/stop

To start the HTTP service we use:
	systemctl start apache2

Other ways would be using python or other applications abstracting http/https service

To manually start an HTTP service in Ubuntu without relying on systemd or service, you can use a simple command-line HTTP server like http-server or busybox httpd. Alternatively, you can use python3 -m http.server for a basic server. 
Here's a breakdown of a few options:
1. Using http-server (requires installation):

    Install http-server: sudo apt install http-server
    Navigate to the directory: cd /path/to/your/directory
    Start the server: http-server
        This will start a server on port 8080 by default.
        To specify a different port, use -p <port_number> (e.g., http-server -p 80).
        To serve from a specific directory, use -d <directory>. 

2. Using busybox httpd (if busybox is installed):

    Check if busybox is installed: which busybox
    If not, install it: sudo apt install busybox-static
    Navigate to the directory: cd /path/to/your/directory
    Start the server: busybox httpd -f -vv -p 8080
        -f foreground mode, -vv verbose output, -p 8080 port 8080. 

3. Using python3 -m http.server:

    Navigate to the directory: cd /path/to/your/directory
    Start the server: python3 -m http.server
        This will start a server on port 8000 by default.
        To specify a different port, use --port <port_number> (e.g., python3 -m http.server --port 80). 

Important Considerations:

    Port 80:
    To use port 80, you'll likely need sudo privileges (e.g., sudo http-server -p 80). 

Firewall:
If you have a firewall enabled (like UFW), you might need to configure it to allow traffic on the port you're using. 
Foreground vs. Background:
These commands run in the foreground, meaning the terminal will be blocked until you stop the server (usually with Ctrl+C).
