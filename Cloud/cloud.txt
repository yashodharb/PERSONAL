Monolith vs Microservices

Monolith:
A monolithic architecture is a traditional software development model where all application components are packagedtogether and deployed as a single unit. 

Microservices:
A microservices architecture breaks down an application into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs.

Containers are more faster than virtualiztion.
Production code and libraries and dependencies are bundled together.
